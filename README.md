   Allowing to play and simulate the game of snakes and ladders. Please follow the instructions when the game starts. </p>
   
   
 ## About the proyect: <br> 
 
## what should you know about the implementation? <br>
1. You must type the input in **one** line in the required format which is: **rows columns snakes ladders amountOfPlayers.**
2. The game will advance pressing enter key.
3. Instead of pressing the enter key you can type the command **"simul"** to simulate the current game.
4. You can also type the command **"num"** for seeing the number of each position in the board.
5. By typing the command **"menu"** you can shut down the current game and go back to the main menu.
6. _**To avoid problems:**_ the program only accepts minimum number **4 rows**.
7. Progam uses colors in the consol. However, it only works on **linux**. If you're a Windows user probably you will see some **strange** characters i the board it is just becauce of this. 
8. If you are using **Eclipse IDE** and you have the problem above you can run the game wihtout IDE by using the folowing commands **javac -cp src /src/ui/Main.java -d bin** and then **java -cp bin ui.Main** **(We recomend using InteliJ IDEA ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜‰)** 
9. Finally Have fun!! ðŸ˜Ž
